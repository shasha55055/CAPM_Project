Capital Asset Pricing Model: Ra = Rf + B(Rm - Rf)
- Independent usage
    -Is a stock fairly priced when comparing expected return with time value and curent risk
-Risk Free Rate(Rf)
    - the chance you get money back
    - practicly,government bonds and treasury bills are a benchmark for rfr
    -any other investment has a higher rfr than the government
-Beta(B)L B = (Covariance(Ri, Rm))/(Variance(Rm))
    - How an asset moved in reponse to the rise and fall of the market
    - Beta of whole market = 1
    - measures stock volatility
    - Covariance
        - Rm = Market Index average return = reflects health of overall market
            - S and P 500 return
            -Dow Jones return
        - Ri = percent return
    - Variance
        - Market index return

-Expected Market Return(Rm)
- What does CAPM show?
    - Help calulate WACC(Weighted Average Capital Cost)
        - Uses Cost of Dept and Cost of Equity as factors
        - Used to calulate Discounted Cash Flow
        - CAPM is used as cost of equity
        - If no Debt example
            - Discount factor = 1 + CAPM
            - Present value of expected future cash flow = Expected future cash flow / 1 + CAPM
